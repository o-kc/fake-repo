# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

Kevin Chen

# Intentions:

Making a terminal-based chat program

# Intended usage:

A server connects client data (files)

# Technical Details:
**1.** The chat program server will accept clients which write to it.                             
**2.** Semaphores to organize read-write order
Sockets to connect client-server
Allocating memory in case there needs to be non-stack storage
Signal handling for keys
May use shared mem if processes inside computer must communicate                               
**3.** Project Files : Server + Client + Helper(s) to confirm handshake and check status / activity


# Intended pacing:
Jan 5: Planning on what system features are needed 
Jan 6: Start helper file + .h libraries
Jan 7: Make server file + client file using helpers
Jan 8: Finish server and client
